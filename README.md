# Chocolate Warehouse Manager in Java 🍫

A simple console-based Java application that allows users to manage an inventory of Milka chocolates. Built to practice core Java concepts like arrays, loops, conditionals, and sorting.

---

## ✨ Features

- Register chocolate items
- List all registered chocolates with their array index
- Search for a specific chocolate by name
- Display all chocolates in alphabetical order

---

## 📈 Technologies Used

- Java (JDK 17+)
- Arrays
- Loops (`do-while`, `for`)
- Conditional statements (`switch`, `if`)
- `Scanner` for user input
- `Arrays.sort()` for alphabetical ordering

---

## 🔧 How It Works

1. Run the program.
2. Choose options from the menu:
   - `1` to add chocolates
   - `2` to view all chocolates
   - `3` to search for a chocolate
   - `4` to sort and view chocolates alphabetically
   - `0` to exit
3. Input is handled via `Scanner`, stored in a `String[]` array.
